Title: Finiteness and infiniteness of the Torelli groups of (hyper)-Kahler manifolds  

Abstract: The Torelli group of a closed smooth manifold X is the subgroup of the mapping class group consisting of elements which act trivially on the integral cohomology of X. In this note we give counterexamples to a theorem by Verbitsky which states that the Torelli group of simply connected Kahler manifolds of complex dimension >2 is finite. We also give a counterexample to the theorem of Verbitsky which claims that the Torelli group of hyper-Kahler manifolds are finite. Finally we confirm the finiteness result for the special case of the hyper-Kahler manifold K[2]. This is a joint work with M.Kreck.

Title: On the topology of String manifolds of dimension $24$  

Abstract: String can be viewed as higher version of Spin, while the latter plays a fundamental role in Atiyah-Singer index theory. People try to develop parallel theory for String, the whole story of which is still mystery. Geometry and topology of String manifolds then attract increasing attentions and interests. In this talk, following Hirzebruch, Mahowald-Hopkins we will discuss both the topological and index theoretical aspects of $24$-dimensional String manifolds. In particular, we will give an integral basis for the String cobordism groups at dimension 24, and also show divisibility of various characteristic classes. Besides others both the classical Borel-Hirzebruch algorithm and Duan’s Spin classes will be used for the calculations.  

This is joint work with Fei Han (NUS) in progress. The initial motivation for this project is a question of Teichner, which will be also addressed and discussed. I may propose a conjecture, which is right I believe.

Title: On the injection of the fixed point set into the homotopy fixed point set  

Abstract: Given an action of a compact connected Lie group $G$ on the rational nilpotent $G$-space $X$, there exists a natural injection $k:X^{G}\hookrightarrow X^{hG}$ of the fixed point set into the homotopy fixed set. In this topic, we make use of the inclusion $j: X^{G}\hookrightarrow X$ to give an equivalent condition for the rational homotopy morphism $\pi_{\ast}(k)\otimes \mathbb{Q}$ to be injective. Moreover, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the injection $k$ being a rational homotopy equivalence. Our results generalize some known results.
